<!--
	An important sign of a good developer is comments: their presence and even their absense.

Good comments allow us to maintain the code well, come back to it after a delay and use it more effectively.

Comment this:

Overall architecture, high-level view.
Function usage.
Important solutions, especially when not immediately obvious.
Avoid comments:

That tell “how code works” and “what it does”.
Put them only if it’s impossible to make the code so simple and self-descriptive that it doesn’t require those.
Comments are also used for auto-documenting tools like JSDoc3: they read them and generate HTML-docs (or docs in another format).
